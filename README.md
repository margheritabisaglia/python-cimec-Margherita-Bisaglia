# Python Final Assignment 2025 

## Project descrition and objectives 
As final project I decide to analyze and plot data on heart rate (bmp) collecting last years during two experimental campaigns aimed at explore the humans sensititvy to environmental temperatures. 

The first experiment has been conducted at mild uncomfortable temperatures: 
- Cool condition: 18 °C +/- 1 °C 
- Warm condition: 28 °C +/- 1 °C 
The second experiment has been conducted at exteme temperatures: 
- Cold condition: 8 °C +/- 2 °C 
- Hot condition: 38 °C +/- 2 °C 

For both experiment, participants were asked to move between four climate chambers and compare the temperature of couple of chamber by telling the experiment if the second chamber he entered in was warmer or colder than fhe first chamber. 
Skin temperature and sweating were monitored using cutaneous sensors, tympanic temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate were also recorded. 

 Skin and core temperature has been already analyzed but it is still missing an analysiz on the effect of different environmental condition on heart rate. For this reason, the objective of this assignment are: 
 1. Organize the data by creating cvs files for each condition(cold,cool,warm,heat) with only data on Hear rate for each participant 
 2. Plotting heart rate time course for one participant 
 3. Compute premilinary analysis and save all the parameters in another cvs file 
 4. Compute stastistical analysis to test the presence of significant differences 
 5. Plot the results
